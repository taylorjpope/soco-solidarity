    <p>Who we are:

        SoCo Solidarity is a support arm of the <a href="www.scldf.org/">Sonoma County Legel Defense Fund</a>. We are a group of abolitionist volunteers who believe that a world without the Prison Industrial Complex is not only possible, but necessary. No one deserves to be caged. We understand that true freedom and safety for all starts with health, shelter, and liberation for the most marginalized groups: BIPOC, LGBTQ+, impoverished people, and people with disabilities. 
        
        What we do: 
        
        We offer jail support, legal referrals, and healing opportunities for those facing persecution by the capitalist, carceral state. We uplift resilient, interdependent, BIPOC-led, and community-driven models of accountability in order to transform the current systems of oppression and violence. 
        
        Our values:
        
        1. Resistance against the Capitalist and Carceral State
        
        2. Uplifting BIPOC voices, local BIPOC-led groups
        
        3. Direct Action & Mutual Aid</p>
